# ZiaCon0-Badge
Badge code and hardware schematics for the ZiaCon0 Badge

KiCad project and gerbers are located in the Hardware Folder

An Ardunio project is located in the software folder. Please note that
the .ino project is blank. It just pulls in the tinytouch libraries. In the 
tinytouch library folder there is a main.c file which contains the badge code.
I did not have time to pull the code out of there and make a proper ardunio project so
I just ran with what the library was already pointing to.
